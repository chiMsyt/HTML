What is HTML?
- stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- standard language for creating web pages
- describes the structure of a web page
- consists of a series of elements
- elements tell the browser how to display the content

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

What is an HTML element?
an html element is defined by a start tag, some content and an end tag:

the HTML element is everything from the start to the end tag

Some HTML elements haveno content -> <br>, these are called empty elements.
Empty elements do not have an end tag

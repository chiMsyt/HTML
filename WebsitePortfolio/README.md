# 🌐 My Portfolio & Projects

Hi! I’m Tim 👋  
I’m a **Data Science and Analytics student** specializing in **Python** and exploring different programming languages, tools, and frameworks.  
This repository contains my **personal website/portfolio**, which I’ll continuously update to reflect my journey, projects, and growth.

## About This Repository
This repo is the **home of my website**, built from scratch using **HTML, CSS**. 
It serves as my:
- **Portfolio** — Showcasing my projects, skills, and achievements.
- **Roadmap** — Documenting my progress as I learn new tools and build new things.
- **Sandbox** — A space for me to experiment with new ideas before I move them into larger projects.

You can visit my portfolio here:

## Tech Stack
This project is primarily built with:
- **HTML5** — Structure  
- **CSS3** — Styling & Layout  

Planned updates:
- Responsive design with media queries  
- Component-based styling (CSS variables / TailwindCSS)  
- Backend integration (Python/Flask or Node.js)

## 📌 Roadmap
I’ll be updating this site regularly with:
- **Current projects** I’m working on  
- **Learning logs** from Data Science, Web Dev, and Software Engineering  
- **Analytics/Dashboard demos** as I practice tools like **Pandas, scikit-learn, Power BI, and Tableau**  
- **Mini apps and experiments** (Java, Python, and R side-projects)
